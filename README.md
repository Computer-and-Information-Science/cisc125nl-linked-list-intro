# A Linked List Template Class

Starter code for an in-class exercise introducing linked lists.

A linked list is a data structure that stores objects as an ordered list.
Typical operations of a linked list include ability to append an object to
the end of the list, prepend an object at the beginning of the list, insertion
of objects in the list, access to objects by their position in the list,
and navigation of objects sequentially.

For this exercise, the following operations will be implemented:

- Structure of a linked list node
- Member variables to maintiain the list
  - Pointers to head and tail nodes
  - Count of objects in the list
- Initialization of the list (constructor)
- Get the list's size (count of objects in the list)
- Appending and prepending objects to the list
- Print all objects in the list (navigation)
- Accessing an object by its index (operator[])
  - Replace object by its index
- Finding an object's index
- Inserting an object at some index
- Removing an object by its index
- Removing all objects from the list
- Implement the destructor
- Implement a copy constructor
- Implement the assignment operator
